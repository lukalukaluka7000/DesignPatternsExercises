## Counting numbers in lotto and displaying how many times certain combination occurred.

Test it out by executing .exe in beta folder. You will need to provide libxl.dll (available at their web page) inside the folder. You can mess around with config.txt specifying from which excel to read. Just start with Raw (Simulating real data inside code)


## config.txt example:

```
FetchDataMode = ... (Raw, Excel)
FileName = ... (arbitrary, with or without format specified)
```


In place of three dots put your preferences. There are options in parenthesis that current build supports.
